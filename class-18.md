# What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?

> The basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet. Historically, it was used by Julius Caesar to protect sensitive military messages, where he would shift the letters by three positions.

# What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?

> The key difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption is in the use of keys. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Asymmetric encryption is commonly used in secure communication today for tasks like key exchange, digital signatures, and establishing secure connections in protocols like HTTPS.

# How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.

> Computers generate random numbers using algorithms called random number generators (RNGs). True random number generation (TRNG) relies on unpredictable physical processes, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay, to generate random numbers. Pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) uses algorithms to generate sequences of numbers that appear random, but are actually deterministic and repeatable. TRNG is used when high-quality randomness is crucial, such as in cryptography or gambling, while PRNG is suitable for most other applications where statistical randomness is sufficient.

# Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.



> Encryption and decryption are two processes used in cryptography. Encryption involves converting plaintext into a secret code or cipher to protect its confidentiality. It's like putting a message inside a locked box that only the intended recipient can open. Decryption, on the other hand, is the process of converting the encrypted message back into its original plaintext using a key, which is like unlocking the box to retrieve the message.
