# what are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of computing resources. Here are the key characteristics of serverless computing and how it differs from traditional server-based architectures:

No Server Management: In serverless computing, developers do not need to worry about server management tasks such as server provisioning, scaling, or maintenance. The cloud provider takes care of these responsibilities, allowing developers to focus solely on writing and deploying code.

Event-Driven and Stateless: Serverless applications are event-driven, meaning they execute code in response to events or triggers. They typically follow a stateless architecture, where each function execution is independent and does not maintain any persistent state between invocations. This enables better scalability and fault tolerance.

Granular Billing: Serverless platforms charge users based on the actual usage of resources, typically measured in milliseconds of code execution, rather than charging for pre-provisioned servers or infrastructure. Users only pay for the resources consumed during the execution of their functions or applications.
# How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?
To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, you can follow these main steps:

Create a Vercel Account: Visit the Vercel website (vercel.com) and sign up for an account. You can use your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account to authenticate with Vercel.

Install Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface): Install the Vercel CLI tool globally on your local machine. The CLI allows you to deploy projects and serverless functions directly from the command line. You can install it using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command:
```
npm install -g vercel

```
Deploy the Serverless Function: Once the project is initialized, you can deploy the serverless function using the Vercel CLI. Run the following command:
```
vercel

```
# What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. They define a set of methods, data formats, and conventions that enable developers to access and manipulate data or functionality provided by external systems, services, or platforms.
# What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?
The Requests library in Python is a popular and powerful HTTP library that simplifies sending HTTP requests and handling responses. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly API for making HTTP requests, handling various types of data, and managing sessions.

To interact with APIs using the Requests library, you can use its get(), post(), put(), delete(), and other methods to send HTTP requests to the desired API endpoints. These methods handle the low-level details of constructing and sending requests, handling redirects, managing sessions, and parsing responses.

Here's an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:
```
import requests

# Send a GET request to the API endpoint
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

# Check the response status code
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Request succeeded
    data = response.json()  # Parse the response as JSON
    print(data)
else:
    # Request failed
    print('Request failed with status code:', response.status_code)

```
