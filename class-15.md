### Use an analogy:
When teaching a complex concept, you can use an analogy to relate it to something more familiar. For example, when explaining how electricity flows in a circuit, you can compare it to water flowing through pipes.

### Explain a detail in depth:
Choose a specific aspect of a topic and dive deep into it, providing a comprehensive explanation. For instance, if teaching about climate change, you can focus on the causes and effects of deforestation and explore its impact on the environment.

### Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure:
Organize your teaching by first explaining why the topic is important, then covering what it entails, and finally addressing how it can be applied or understood. This structure helps provide context and clarity to your students.

Tutorial/walk through an example:
Take a step-by-step approach to guide your students through a practical example or problem. This technique is effective in subjects like mathematics or programming, where demonstrating the process can enhance understanding.

### Write a quiz:
Engage your students by creating a quiz that assesses their knowledge on a specific topic. Incorporate multiple-choice questions or open-ended prompts to encourage critical thinking and reinforce key concepts.
