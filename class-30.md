Why use hash tables?

Hash tables are used for efficient storage, retrieval, and deletion of key-value pairs.
They provide constant-time average case complexity for common operations, such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval.
Hash tables are beneficial when there is a need for fast data lookup, caching, or indexing.
They are widely used in programming languages and libraries to implement dictionaries or associative arrays.
What are hash tables?

A hash table, also known as a hash map or dictionary, is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to unique indices within an underlying array or bucket structure.
It allows for the storage of key-value pairs and provides fast access to values based on their associated keys.
The hash function takes a key as input and computes an index where the corresponding value will be stored.
Hash tables offer efficient storage and retrieval of data by minimizing the need for linear searching.
How do hash tables work?

Hash tables consist of an underlying array or bucket structure and a hash function.
When inserting a key-value pair, the hash function calculates the index by transforming the key into a unique numerical value within the array's bounds.
The value is then stored at the computed index in the array or bucket.
During retrieval, the hash function is applied again to the key, which allows direct access to the index where the corresponding value is stored.
In case of collisions, where multiple keys hash to the same index, additional techniques like chaining or open addressing can be used to resolve conflicts and store multiple values at the same index.
