# Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

## Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)
The amount of time a function needs to complete.

## Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)
The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

# Linked Lists
## What is a Linked List
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.

# Whatâ€™s a Linked List

A linked list is a data structure used in computer programming for storing and organizing a collection of data. It consists of a series of nodes, each of which contains a data element and a reference (or "pointer") to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node has a reference to a null value, indicating the end of the list.

Unlike an array, a linked list does not store its elements in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position in the list. However, accessing elements in a linked list can be slower than in an array, as each element must be traversed one by one until the desired element is reached.

There are two main types of linked lists: singly linked lists, where each node has a reference to only the next node, and doubly linked lists, where each node has references to both the next and previous nodes in the list.
