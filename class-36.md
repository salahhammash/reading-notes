# strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview

* Take Time to Think: Avoid immediately speaking and writing code after the problem is presented. Ask for a moment to think, gather your thoughts, and devise a clear plan before explaining your approach.

# What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video

In the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video, Gayle McDowell discusses the engineering interview process and offers valuable insights for both candidates and companies.

Interview Focus: Gayle emphasizes that technical interviews should assess a candidate's problem-solving skills and intelligence, aiming to predict their potential as a good employee rather than being entirely realistic.

Interview Questions: The interview questions should be challenging and centered around problem-solving rather than relying on obscure knowledge or trick questions. This approach helps evaluate a candidate's ability to handle difficult problems effectively.

Interview Preparation: Gayle advises candidates to spend a few weeks preparing for interviews, focusing on gaining comfort with fundamental data structures and algorithms. She encourages individuals without formal computer science degrees or from bootcamps to build confidence in their problem-solving abilities.

Making Hiring Decisions: Companies should prioritize a candidate's overall attributes instead of seeking a unanimous decision from all interviewers. Each interviewer should assess candidates based on specific attributes they are evaluating, leading to a more balanced hiring decision process.
