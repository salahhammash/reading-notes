**What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

One of the most important things to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the efficiency of the data structure in terms of time and space complexity for the operations that will be performed on it.

**How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack**


1. Stack size limit: We can increase the stack size limit, but this is not always a good solution, as it may lead to memory issues.

2. Iteration: We can also consider implementing an iterative solution instead of a recursive solution. In some cases, an iterative solution can be more efficient and less prone to stack overflow errors.
