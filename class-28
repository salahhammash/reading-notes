# Django Forms: Facilitating User Input Handling and Key Components

> Django Forms simplify user input handling in web applications by allowing developers to define HTML forms using Python classes. Key components include creating a form class, rendering forms in templates, form validation, handling form submissions, and customizing form widgets.

# Django Templates: Purpose and Template Inheritance

> Django Templates separate presentation logic from business logic in web development. They define the structure and layout of web pages. Template inheritance allows the creation of a base template for common elements, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

# Django Views: Handling HTTP Requests and Function-Based vs. Class-Based Views

> Django Views handle HTTP requests and generate responses. Function-based views are simple Python functions for request handling. Class-based views are Python classes that offer more flexibility and built-in functionalities, allowing clearer separation of concerns based on request methods. The choice depends on the application's complexity and requirements.
