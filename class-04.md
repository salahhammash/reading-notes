# What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that defines a set of attributes and methods that the object will have. An object is an instance of a class, which means that it is created using the blueprint provided by the class.

The key differences between classes and objects in Python are:

Classes are the template or blueprint for creating objects, whereas objects are instances of the class created using the blueprint.
A class can have many instances or objects, each with their own unique set of attributes and methods.
Classes can be inherited from other classes to create new classes with additional functionality, while objects cannot be inherited or modified in this way.

# Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that terminates the recursion. Recursive functions can be used to solve problems that have a recursive structure or can be decomposed into smaller subproblems.
example :
<!-- 
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
 -->

# What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
Pytest fixtures and code coverage are two important tools for testing Python code. Pytest fixtures provide a way to set up and tear down test environments, while code coverage measures the percentage of code that is executed during testing.

The purpose of fixtures is to provide a standardized way to set up and tear down test environments. A fixture is a function that is run before or after a test function and can be used to create and configure objects that are needed for the test. Fixtures can be used to set up database connections, create temporary files, and perform other tasks that are needed for testing.

Using fixtures and code coverage together can improve the quality and maintainability of a project by ensuring that tests are run consistently in a controlled environment and that the code coverage is sufficient to catch potential bugs. By using fixtures to set up the test environment, you can reduce duplication and increase test readability. By measuring code coverage, you can identify areas of the code that need additional testing and ensure that the tests are thorough enough to catch potential bugs.
