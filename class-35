In data structures, a graph is a collection of nodes and edges, where the nodes represent entities and the edges represent connections between those nodes.
A graph is used to represent relational relationships and connections between different elements.
The two main types of graphs are directed and undirected graphs.
In a directed graph, the edges have a direction associated with them, indicating the direction of the relationship between nodes.
A graph can be represented using various data structures, such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.
Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are two common algorithms used to traverse or search a graph.
In DFS, the traversal starts at a starting node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
In BFS, the traversal starts at a starting node and explores all the neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next depth level.
A tree is a graph that has no cycles and is connected.
In graph theory, the acyclicity of a graph refers to the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to make the graph acyclic.
A minimum spanning tree is a subset of edges from a connected, undirected graph that connects all the vertices together with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.
The time complexity for traversing a graph using DFS or BFS is O(V + E).
Graphs can be used to solve various real-world problems, such as transportation networks, social networks, and recommendation systems.
Graph algorithms play a crucial role in solving problems like finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, and identifying connected components in a network.
