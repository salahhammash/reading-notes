### What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method.

under methods (short for double underscore methods) in Python are special methods that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.). They are also known as magic methods or special methods because they provide special behaviors for Python classes. These methods are used to define how an object behaves in certain situations, such as when it is being compared to another object, when it is being printed, or when it is being added to another object.

For example, the __str__ method is commonly used to define how an object should be printed as a string. Here's an example:

--> 
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person(name={self.name}, age={self.age})"
    
p = Person("Alice", 30)
print(p) 

 Output: Person(name=Alice, age=30)


### In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?
the main ethical issue raised was that the AI guru was selling a course that was based on the work of other developers without giving them credit or compensation. This is an issue of intellectual property theft and plagiarism. The developers' work should have been properly licensed or attributed, and the AI guru should have obtained permission to use it in their course.

### Describe the Python statistics module and give an example of a function within the module that can be used to perform a common statistical operation
The Python statistics module is a built-in module that provides functions for statistical calculations. Some of the functions in this module include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, etc. Here's an example of how to use the mean function:
-->

import statistics

data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
mean = statistics.mean(data)
print(mean)  # Output: 30

In this example, we import the statistics module and use the mean function to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The resulting mean is then printed to the console.
